//! dante-asio's ASIO driver (plan Task 6): one DLL, registered under one
//! CLSID per instance ([`ident`]); each instance's audio goes through its
//! device process's shared memory (`shm`). The device is the clock: the
//! driver's worker thread waits for each published block and calls the
//! DAW's `bufferSwitchTimeInfo`. With no device it free-runs silence on its
//! own timer, so the DAW never hangs, and asks the DAW for a reset once the
//! device is there.
