//!
//! Per block `seq`: the RX samples into half `seq % 2`'s input buffers (24
//! bits left-justified in `i32`, as ASIO's `Int32LSB`), `seq` published and
//! the block event signalled; the outputs are the DAW's answer to the block
//! before (half `(seq - 1) % 2`), taken when its `ack` is in. The pump never
//! waits: the DAW has one block's time to answer, and a missing answer is
//! silence and a late count. The cost is one block on the way out
//! (`latencies` counts it).
