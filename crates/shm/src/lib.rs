//! The shared memory between the ASIO driver (in the DAW's process) and its
//! instance's device process (plan Task 5).
//!
//! One mapping per instance: a [`Header`], then two halves of buffers, each
//! half holding the RX buffers (the DAW's inputs) then the TX buffers (its
//! outputs), one per channel, `block` samples of `i32` (24 bits left-justified,
//! ASIO's `Int32LSB`), each 64-byte aligned. The device is the clock: per
//! block it fills the inputs of half `seq % 2`, bumps [`Header::seq`] and
//! signals the block event; the driver's thread hands that half to the DAW
//! and, once the DAW has written its outputs, stores the same number in
//! [`Header::ack`] and signals the ready event.
