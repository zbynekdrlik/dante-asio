# dante-asio

Our own Dante device per instance on Windows, opened by a DAW as an ASIO driver: the DAW
talks to Dante directly, at the lowest latency the PC holds. Several instances run at once,
each with its own Dante name, address, channels and buffer, set from a tray icon.

Built on the Dante stack of [iemmixer](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/iemmixer)
(`iem-dante`, from [dstack](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/dstack)). Design: `docs/design/`; plan: `docs/plans/`.
